# Segregation Metrics of 14 U.S. Cities

Using the population statistics of each tract of 14 U.S. Cities I have completed the following: 

- Calculated and visualized the Gini Index, Exposure Metrics and Delta Index for each of these cities 

- Discussed the positives and negatives of current segregation metrics

- Proposed Zo-Index, a new segregation metric used to calculate how diverse a city is

***This was initially an assignment for INFO 370, a class taught by Professor Mike Freeman of the Information School at the University of Washington. I spent time after this assignment to build upon the visualizations I made for this class.***
